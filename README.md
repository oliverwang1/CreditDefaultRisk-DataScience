# CreditDefaultRisk-DataScience

This repository is the output from a class project for the [INFO-GB.3336 Data Mining for Business Analytics](#data-mining-for-business-analytics-course-description) course at [NYU Stern School of Business](http://www.stern.nyu.edu/) taught by Puneet Batra.  

For this project, we built and tuned several models predicting Home Credit Default Risk, as per the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk). 

We found an excellent [Kaggle Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/start-here-a-gentle-introduction) by [Will Koehrsen](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen) that we generally followed.

**More information about the project, evaluation metrics, etc to come soon!**

## Metrics 
The metric by which the Kaggle competition was judged was the Receiver Operator Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC).  Before diving into exactly what this measure means, let's back up and take a look at the purpose of the competition and the importance and cost of different types of error.

The first thing to understand in order to grasp all of the various metrics is the confusion matrix, shown below.  



## Data Mining For Business Analytics Course Description
Businesses governments and individuals create massive collections of data as a by-product of their activity. Increasingly data is analyzed systematically to improve decision-making. In many cases automating analytical processes is necessary because of the volume of data and the speed with which data are generated. We will examine how data analytics technologies are used to improve decision-making. We will study the fundamental principles and techniques of mining data and we will examine real-world examples and cases to place data-mining techniques in context	to improve your data-analytic thinking and to illustrate that proper application is as much an art as it is a science. In addition we will work hands on with data mining software. After taking this course you should: Approach business problems data analytically. Think carefully & systematically about whether & how data can improve business performance to make better-informed decisions. Be able to interact competently on business analytics topics. Know the fundamental principles of data science that are the basis for analytics processes algorithms & systems. Understand these well enough to work on data science projects and interact with everyone involved. Envision new opportunities. Have had hands-on experience mining data. Be prepared to follow up on ideas or opportunities that present themselves by performing pilot studies.
